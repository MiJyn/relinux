<p>Relinux is an advanced Application Development product based on Microsoft’s Windows operating system. It excels in the development and maintenance of portable applications allowing users to write only one specification, one time, for many different platforms ranging from mainframes, midrange systems, to PCs and PDAs. 1Spec is a professional developer’s environment for the natural extension and abbreviation of the COBOL language plus program components in Visual Basic, HTML/ASP, Java (and more) where required to leverage a relevant technology.</p>

<p>Relinux increases programming productivity by generating programs for multiple platforms from a single specification. Now:</p>

<p>Relinux makes COBOL portable across any target machine or multiple target machines
You are empowered to market your software solutions to new market segments (customers, prospects and business partners) without hiring specialists for each platform type
Reduce the effort and cost to maintain and enhance existing legacy systems from a single programmer workstation
Use one or more of Oracle, DMSll, DB2, Informix, Sybase, databases
You can now implement the appropriate hardware platform for the business requirements or replace outdated or redundant hardware
Generate programs enterprise wide – without learning all the nuances applicable to the various platforms and systems on the network
Drastically reduce the cost to maintain and enhance existing legacy systems from a single programmer workstation
The Benefits</p>

<p>Up to 90% savings off the typical development time as compared to manual coding
Maintenance on generated code is 50% less than comparable native COBOL
Instant applicability, mix new tasks in 1Spec in any combination with legacy code
Reusable code reduces application redundancy
Focus on your enterprise/business needs rather than lower level issues
Present and future integration of legacy systems with best-of-breed software
Already field proven by users in all industries
1Spec workstation-based application development environment is proven in a wide variety of enterprise-wide and client-server situations.
